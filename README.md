GETTING STARTED
---------------

If any files fail on wabbajack you can check the pins in the help channel ondiscord for a manual link.( if you don't see a link then let me now in the help channel and I gladly send you the link and pin it)

Once you installed SSO through Wabbajack the modlist should be ready to play...just launch the skse through MO2.

Please go to the mcm and look for mcm recorder. Run the Essential Recording and wait for it to finish.

If you find no animations are being used and Player or NPCs are T Posing then use the NEMESIS executable in MO2....just click update engine and Launch.
Nemesis Output should automatically go into the Nemesis Folder..if not then just move the overwrite data to Nemesis. The mod is located in the LEAVE AT BOTTOM  Separator.( If Nemesis crashes or any problems show up then reinstall Nemesis from the download section in MO2.)

If you want to add any outfits to female character then make sure CBBE 3BA Amazing Body is selected and Zeroed Sliders.
Then under the outfit filter type the name of the outfit then click batch build and the outfit should show up and just click build.
(OBody will automatically scale the outfit for whatever bodyslide preset you want to use. Press O ingame to select your body preset.)

Keep Flat World Map Framework Mod and Plugins at the bottom of the load order.

-------
IN GAME
-------

Wait for all MCM Settings to load and then proceed to open the MCM to configure the game to the way you want to play.

Don't forget to open your inventory and read the Classes Book to choose your CLASS and BIRTH-SIGN.
 
Pickup whatever items you want...then talk to the Dragon to pick your start. ( Walk out the door without talking to be inside the Helgen Inn and talk to the inn keeper and selevet START INTRO if you want to start the Main Quest.)

Next thing is.............DO WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT!!! ITS YOUR PLAYTHROUGH FROM HERE ON OUT!!!!!!! HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!
